# Enables setting the "flush to zero" CPU flag to avoid denormal numbers when
# processing. This can lead to a significant performance increases in some cases.
#
# HOWEVER, the Rust compiler technically considers this to be undefined behavior,
# so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Though if any UB did occur, the only damage will
# likely just be audio glitches, not memory safety issues.
#
# Note, performance issues due to denormal numbers only effect x86 targets (ARM,
# WASM, and RISC-V targets are all uneffected by denormal numbers).
#
# For more information on why this is considered undefined behavior, see:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/x86_64/fn._mm_setcsr.html
#
# There is also currently an open issue to fix the "undefined behavior" status:
# https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136469
#
# For an explanation on why denormal numbers are a problem, see:
# https://mu.krj.st/denormal/
